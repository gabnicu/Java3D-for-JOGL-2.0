// Create new screen objects and associate them with logical names and numbers.

// Set the available image areas for full screens.  This is important when
// precise scaling between objects in the virtual world and their projections
// into the physical world is desired through use of explicit ScreenScale view
// attributes.  The defaults are 0.365 meters for width and 0.292 meters for
// height.

// the top, and Z increasing away from the screen.
//
// Without head or sensor tracking the tracker base is still needed as a point
// of reference for describing the orientation and position of each screen to
// the others.  The coexistence to tracker base transform is set to identity by
// default, so the tracker base origin and orientation will also set the origin
// and orientation of coexistence coordinates in the physical world.

// The tracker base and center of coexistence are set here to the center of the
// 2x2 array with its basis vectors aligned to image plate coordinates.
