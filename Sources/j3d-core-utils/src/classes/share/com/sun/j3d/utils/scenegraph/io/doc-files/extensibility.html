</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<h1>
Using your own Classes with scenegraph.io
</h1>
<P>The scenegraph.io APIs will handle the IO for all the core Java3D
SceneGraphObjects. However, if you create a subclass of one of these
objects and add it to your Scene Graph, the IO system, by default,
will not store any state information specific to your class.</P>
<P>The default behavior when an unrecognized SceneGraphObject class
is encountered is to traverse up the superclasses of the object until
a recognized Java3D class is located. The data structures for this
class are then used for IO. The system does store the class name of
the original object.
<P>For example:
<pre><font size=-1>
public class MyBranchGroup extends javax.media.j3d.BranchGroup {
    private int myData;
    ....
}
</font></pre>
<P>When the Scene Graph is written to a file and this node is
encountered, the superclass javax.media.j3d.BranchGroup will be used
to store all the state for the object so any children of
MyBranchGroup, the capabilities, etc. will be stored, but myData will
be lost. When the scene graph is loaded, MyBranchGroup will be
instantiated and will be populated with all the state from
BranchGroup but myData will have been lost.</P>
<P>To overcome this, the scenegraph.io API provides an interface for
you to implement in your own classes that provides the opportunity
for you to save the state of your classes during the IO processes.
This is the SceneGraphIO interface.</P>
<P>When the scenegraph is saved, the methods of SceneGraphIO are
called in this order 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>createSceneGraphObjectReferences</P>
	<LI><P>saveChildren</P>
	<LI><P>writeSceneGraphObject</P>
</OL>
<P>During the load cycle the method call order is</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Instantiate Object using default constructor</P>
	<LI><P>Populate object with state from superclasses</P>
	<LI><P>readSceneGraphObject</P>
	<LI><P>restoreSceneGraphObjectReferences</P>
</OL>
<P>Within each method you need to perform the following actions:
<UL>
	<LI><P><b>createSceneGraphObjectReferences</b> If your object has
	references to other SceneGraphObjects then you need to obtain an
	object reference (int) for each reference using the
	SceneGraphReferenceControl object passed as a parameter to this
	method. If you don't have references to other SceneGraphObjects then
	no action is required.</P>
	<LI><P><b>saveChildren</b> If your object is a subclass of Group and you
	want the scenegraph.io package to save the children then this must
	return true. If it returns false, the object will be saved but not
	its children.</P>
	<LI><P><b>writeSceneGraphObject</b> In this method you must write all the
	state information for your class, including the object references
	obtained in createSceneGraphObjectReferences, to the DataOutput
	stream passed into this method.</P>
	<LI><P><b>readSceneGraphObject</b> By the time this method is called your
	class has been instantiated and the state information in the Java3D
	superclass will have been loaded. You should load all the state
	information you saved for your class.</P>
	<LI><P><b>restoreSceneGraphObjectReferences</b> is called once all the
	SceneGraph objects have been loaded and allows you to restore the
	references to the other SceneGraph objects.</P>
</UL>
<P>Here are some examples.  Only the parts of the source pertaining to
IO are show....</P>
<h2>Behavior Example</h2>
<pre><blockquote><font size=-1>
public class BehaviorIO extends javax.media.j3d.Behavior implements SceneGraphIO
    private TransformGroup target;   // The TG on which this behavior acts
    private int targetRef;  // Object Reference for target

    public void createSceneGraphObjectReferences( SceneGraphObjectReferenceControl ref ) {
        targetRef = ref.addReference( target );
    }

    public void restoreSceneGraphObjectReferences( SceneGraphObjectReferenceControl ref ) {
        target = (TransformGroup)ref.resolveReference( targetRef );
    }

    public void writeSceneGraphObject( java.io.DataOutput out ) throws IOException {
        out.writeInt( targetRef );
    }

    public void readSceneGraphObject( java.io.DataInput in ) throws IOException {
	targetRef = in.readInt();
    }

    // This has no effect as this is not a subclass of Group
    public boolean saveChildren() {
        return true;
    }
</font></blockquote></pre>
<h2>
`BlackBox' Group Example
</h2>
This example is a Group node that creates its subgraph during
its instantiation.  An example where you might use this is to
represent some geometry that is loaded from an external file format
such a OpenFLT.
<blockquote><pre><font size=-1>
public class House extends Group implements SceneGraphIO {
    public House() {
        super();
        this.addChild( OpenFlightLoader.load( &quot;/dir/house.flt&quot; );
    }

    public void createSceneGraphObjectReferences( SceneGraphObjectReferenceControl ref ) {
        // No references
    }

    public void restoreSceneGraphObjectReferences( SceneGraphObjectReferenceControl ref ) {
        // No references
    }

    public void writeSceneGraphObject( java.io.DataOutput out ) throws IOException {
        // No local state
    }

    public void readSceneGraphObject( java.io.DataInput in ) throws IOException {
        // No local state
    }

    public boolean saveChildren() {
        // Don't save the children as they will be restored by the openflightloader
        return false;
    }
</font></blockquote></pre>
