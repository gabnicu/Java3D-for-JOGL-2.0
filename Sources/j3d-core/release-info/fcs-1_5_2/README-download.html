<h2>Instructions for Installing Java&nbsp;3D 1.5.2</h2>
<p>The 1.5.2 version of the Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
API runs on JDK version
1.5.0 and higher. It has been released for the Windows, Linux,
Solaris, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X operating environments. See the
<a href="http://j3d-core.dev.java.net/j3d1_5_2/RELEASE-NOTES.html">release
notes</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Preferred method</h3>

<p>Developers who wish to develop an application using the Java&nbsp;3D API
are encouraged to download the j3d-1_5_2-XXX.zip file for
their platform, and manually install the necessary files into a
directory on their local disk. To do this, unzip the downloaded file,
and follow the instructions in the unzipped README.txt file.
</p>

<h3>Alternative method</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you can run the installer as shown below, keeping in
mind that it is not recommended to install the j3d jar files and
native libraries directly into the JRE.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>To install the Java&nbsp;3D API on Windows, download the binary
installer and then execute it, by double-clicking on the
j3d-1_5_2-windows-i586.exe (or j3d-1_5_2-windows-amd64.exe)
icon.
</p>

<h4>Linux or Solaris</h4>
<p>To install the Java&nbsp;3D API on Linux or Solaris, download the
self-extracting binary file, chdir to the desired directory, and then
execute it.  For example, on a 32-bit Linux system:
</p>
<ul>
cd /myhome/j3d<br>
sh /path-to-download-files/j3d-1_5_2-linux-i586.bin<br>
</ul>

<p>After doing this, you will need to modify your CLASSPATH
environment variable to include the full paths to j3dcore.jar,
j3dutils.jar, and vecmath.jar. For example:
</p>

<ul>
export CLASSPATH=".:/myhome/j3d/lib/ext/j3dcore.jar:/myhome/j3d/lib/ext/j3dutils.jar:/myhome/j3d/lib/ext/vecmath.jar
</ul>

<p>Then modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to contain the
full path to the "lib/ARCH" directory. For example, on 32-bit Linux:
</p>

<ul>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/myhome/j3d/lib/i386
</ul>

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<p>No installer is available for the Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X operating environment.
You will need to download the j3d-1_5_2-macosx.zip file, unzip it,
and follow the instructions in the unzipped README.txt file.
